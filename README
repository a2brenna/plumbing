Simple Multiplexer

    'mux' is a simple multiplexing utility. It accepts incoming connections on
a unix domain socket and/or TCP port. It then forwards all the data it recieves on
those connections, and from stdin, line by line to stdout.  Very useful for
combining newline delimited data from multiple processes into a single coherent
stream.

The following example combines and forwards all the lines produced by some_process,
some_second_process and a_third_process to stdin of some_other_process.

a2brenna@en12-82:~$ some_process | mux --port 9999 --unix_domain_socket \
/var/run/uds.sock | some_other_process

a2brenna@en12-82:~$ some_second_process | socat - \
UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/uds.sock

a2brenna@gibson:~$ a_third_process | nc en12-82 9999
